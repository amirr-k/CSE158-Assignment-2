    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to **predict the rating a user would give a Home & Kitchen product** based on their past interactions and review text. This is a **regression task**, where the target variable is the `rating` (a continuous value from 1 to 5).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input Features\n",
    "- Review text (`text`)  \n",
    "- Product metadata (`price`, `brand`, `category`)  \n",
    "- User and product IDs for collaborative filtering  \n",

    "## Output\n",
    "- Predicted rating for a given user-product pair  \n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "We will evaluate model performance using:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** – measures the average magnitude of prediction errors.  \n",
    "- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** – provides the average error in predicted ratings.  \n",
    "- **Train/Test Split** – to simulate predicting future reviews, we will split the dataset chronologically or randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "These metrics are appropriate because they directly quantify how close predicted ratings are to the true ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Baseline Models\n",
    "\n",
    "To benchmark performance, we will use **simple, course-relevant baselines**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bias Terms (Global, User, Product averages)** – Predict the rating using overall averages and individual biases.  \n",
    "2. **Collaborative Filtering (Surprise SVD)** – Factorizes the user-item matrix to predict missing ratings.  \n",
    "3. **Optional Advanced Models** – Deep learning models on review text (e.g., RNNs or transformer-based embeddings) may be explored to improve predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "These baselines allow us to **quantify improvements** when moving from simple averages to more complex models.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "To assess the validity of predictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cross-validation** – Split data into folds to check for overfitting.  \n",
    "- **Comparison against baselines** – Any model must outperform simple bias-based predictors and SVD to be meaningful.  \n",
    "- **Residual analysis** – Identify systematic errors for certain users, products, or rating ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that our models are not only accurate on average but also **generalize well across the dataset**.\n"

      "{'rating': 5.0, 'title': 'Excellent for moving & storage & floods!', 'text': 'I purchased these for multiple reasons. The main reason was that I was moving. I was moving bc my apt kept flooding.  Luckily having been through other floods I generally store all my stuff in plastic containers anyways. Sadly a couple of my vintage Singer’s in wooden boxes had been left out during the last move & the last flood got them moldy & ruined them.  I am a bibliophile & these bags held not only huge stacks of my hardcover books, but my 40 pound Singer sewing machines. I also carried hundreds of pounds of yarn (50 per bag) and thousands of pounds of quilting fabric during my move.  It held up to paints, plants, garden pits, & pretty much anything I threw at it. I even put my pots & pans in these bags.  While I still thought they were a bit pricey I did buy some on sale & I think I bought 18 total that I was able to pack & take to my new place & unload & go pack again. Tho I now intend to leave some of my yarn in them as it’s waterproof.  Tho I intend to place it on a top shelf just to be on the safe side. Lol. Not one bag ripped, tore, or had an issue so far that I am aware of tho I have not checked them over very well. And I had no issues with the zippers tho I am positive that I packed several bags well over the weight limit on accident bc I was trying to keep certain quilting fabrics together for a quilt project.  I’ve bought some real duds on Amazon, but this was not one of them. This has by far been one of my better purchases & I’ve told my kids that are planning to move to buy the bags too bc it is just so much easier imo.  I literally used a taxi to move half my stuff (disabled & don’t drive) & was able to fold the bags back down to how they arrived after unpacking to take them back to be packed again.  I also made little tags and used color coded handkerchiefs I hung on the handles so I knew which room the bags went in or knew what was in them without having to open them in the wrong room once I moved.  It saved time.  I live in an apt & these bags take up a lot less space than the massive sterling & Rubbermaid hard sided plastic totes I normally use for moving & craft storage.  I still have them & use them, but storing them is a challenge.  Also, the bags fit under my zinus/spa sensations type elevated platform bed. It’s a frame amazon sells & you buy your own mattress. Normally I can fit 8 hard sided tubs under my bed (queen bed), but I’m limited by the height of the tubs. The bags fit or I’m able to squish to fit if I overfill them which is nice.  Depending on how full you pack them you can get 4-8. They are different sizes than my plastic tubs tho.  I only wish I had stumbled across these bags years ago given how many times I’ve moved.

      "{'rating': 2.0, 'title': 'Lid very loose- needs a gasket imo. Small base.', 'text': '[[VIDEOID:c87e962bc893a948856b0f1b285ce6cc]] I wanted to love this bc I previously bought a matching turquoise teapot, but the loose lid (defective or design flaw? Idk) on the cups is driving me batty. I’m disabled so my gait is not great to begin with & the lid just bangs non-stop while I walk from my kitchen to wherever I’m going with my tea. It’s incredibly annoying.  I had hoped it was just a one-off so I purchased it in another color & sadly it has the same exact problem.  They could fix the problem by adding a rubber gasket or flange to the lid imo & I even thought of doing so myself until I accidentally knocked the cup over due to a design flaw that has a small base on the cup.  I like the lid bc I run a fan continuously & I live with 2 service dogs so I like to keep my drinks covered beyond just the brew times so I really hope they update this cup bc it does keep the tea warm & the size is perfect for a 2 cup brew.<br /><br />I wish they would fix the obvious design flaw of the base that is too small for a cup that tall & wide bc it is also very easy to accidentally knock over as I mentioned above.  I did it several times before I yet boxed them both back up.<br /><br />Overall I like the product as it seems as it was made with quality in mind, but missed the mark in the design phase.  The colors are pretty & the cups I purchased keep the tea warm, but the lids are either defective or a design flaw.  I really hope the company fixes these issue bc the colors match teapots I already own. Lol.

      "{'rating': 5.0, 'title': 'Best purchase ever!', 'text': 'If you live at a higher elevation like me (5k Colorado) just know that after the buzzer beeps you might wanna leave the hard boiled eggs inside the steamed cooker for another minute or two if you want the egg cooked all the way through. I also add a bit more water than the fill line says, but again that’s bc of my elevation & it evaporates quickly.  It’s not any quicker than I used to make them, but it’s a lot less water. I’m disabled & have a TBI rn so the auto-cutoff was a no-brained for me. I bought the blue bc it was cheapest.  My service 🐶  🐶 love hard boiled eggs too so we are enjoying this new addition to our kitchen.  My only regret is that I did not buy it sooner & that Amazon never has the color I want for the cheapest price, but I can live with the bb blue.  We have used it 3x & so far it’s working okay. Oh- don’t place it under upper cabinets as it has a vent hole & it will vent & it will make the cabinets sweat.  Give it some room to breathe imo.  I keep a pair of tongs handy to unload the eggs & dunk them in my ice bath. Yes. You end up using water again, but I have house plants I’ll use it on anyways so it not just wasted water.  If it holds up & doesn’t break down it will truly be one of my top 10 if not top 5 amazon lifetime purchases.  It’s that good.  Nothing is worse than watching eggs boil. Lol.  I start this up at the same time I start my tea brewing and go about feeding the wildlife in my backyard.  It’s just a very peaceful start to my day. I know ppl have said stuff about the buzzer, but honestly I happen to be hearing impaired in both ears & my service dogs are trained to hear for me. I like that it’s loud enough that if my pups are outside & I am in my living room or just outside on my patio with them & my screen door is open then they & often I can still hear it.  I wish appliances had volume options on their alarms, but until then I am very happy with this one.  I am just extremely happy with this purchase. It’s been a long time since I could say that.

He said some of the legs were not properly labeled according to the instruction manual, and screwing the cross-pieces onto the legs was somewhat awkward. I don't think I would have had the patience for it, haha. However, once assembled (see pics) the stools were perfect! The cushions are comfortable, and the cross-pieces on the stool legs are the perfect place to rest your feet. All four legs of each stool sit flush to the floor with no rocking or unsteadiness. One of the reasons I liked these stools over other options is because there are no buttons or other studs that could be broken, pulled, or chewed off. Ha!

Depending on how heavy your usage, you really can't go wrong with this brand, no matter which model you decide on. I know a few people who also have Nesco dehydrators and have nothing but positive things to say about the company.

(Yep, hubs took care of that part. :-)) I researched quite a few storage solutions for jewelry and found several valet/racks that might fir the bill, but this one seemed to have the most versatility in terms of storage of different kinds of jewelry (bracelets, dangle earrings, long and short necklaces, hair ties, etc.) I love that the lower round racks actually spin in a circle  - great for storing long necklaces & for easy access! I use one of the upper horizontal bars to store my hair bands to keep the cats from getting them. The mesh screen is perfect for dangle earrings. I ALMOST gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because there is no solution for stud earrings. The designers thought of everything else but a tray that could hold miscellaneous baubles & earrings with posts. My solution to this was that I hung a small jewelry pouch from the valet and stored those earrings inside the pouch. It means I have to go rooting through the bag a lot, but really this jewelry valet is just perfect for storing everything else and it looks so cute on the wall. Since I really love it I decided to give it 5 stars, since it does exactly what it's advertised to do. My friends always compliment it and it's helped to keep me MUCH more organized.
